    "This notebook explains the main ideas behind AutoGen v0.4 in a way that's easy to understand. You don't need to know any code to follow along. AutoGen is a toolkit from Microsoft that helps you build smart AI systems where different agents (like chatbots or helpers) can work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll break down the main parts of AutoGen, show how they fit together, and give you links to learn more. If you're new to AI agents or want a clear overview, this is for you!\n",

    "## 1. What is AutoGen?\n",
    "AutoGen is a toolkit that helps you build AI systems made up of different agents (like chatbots, helpers, or tools) that can talk to each other and work together. These agents can do things like answer questions, solve problems, or connect to other apps and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use AutoGen?\n",
    "- You can build smart assistants that work together.\n",
    "- It's designed to handle lots of tasks at once (scalable).\n",
    "- You can easily connect it to powerful AI models like GPT-4 or your own local models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's new in version 0.4?**\n",
    "- The core part of AutoGen is now faster and can handle more agents.\n",
    "- There's a simple way to make agents chat with each other (AgentChat).\n",
    "- You can add new features by plugging in extra tools or data sources (Extensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to see a quick example? Check out the [AgentChat Quickstart](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/quickstart.html)."

    "\n",
    "AutoGen is built from three main parts:\n",
    "- **Apps Layer**: These are the things you build, like chatbots or assistants. You can use ready-made apps or create your own.\n",
    "- **Framework Layer**: This is the engine that makes agents work. It helps agents talk to each other, manage tasks, and connect to AI models.\n",
    "- **Developer Tools**: These are extra tools that help you test, build, and improve your agents. For example, you can measure how fast your agents are or design them visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of AutoGen like a team: the Apps are the players, the Framework is the coach, and the Developer Tools are the training equipment."

    "\n",
    "### a. Ready-Made Example: Magentic-One\n",
    "- This is a sample app that shows how agents can work together to solve problems as a team.\n",
    "- You can look at its code to learn how to build your own multi-agent system.\n",
    "- See it on GitHub: [microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Build Your Own App\n",
    "- You can create your own AI apps, like:\n",
    "  - Chatbots for customer support\n",
    "  - Research assistants\n",
    "  - Automated content creators\n",
    "- AutoGen makes it easy to connect your app to smart AI models (like GPT-4 or others).\n",
    "- You can mix and match agents to fit your needs."

    "## 4. How does AutoGen power agents? (Framework Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Core Engine\n",
    "- AutoGen uses an event-driven system, which means agents react to things that happen (like messages or tasks).\n",
    "- Each agent works on its own, but can also talk to other agents.\n",
    "- The system can handle many tasks at the same time, making it fast and scalable.\n",
    "- Learn more: [Core Architecture](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/architecture.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. AgentChat\n",
    "- This is a simple way to make agents have conversations.\n",
    "- You can use built-in agent types like `AssistantAgent` or `UserProxyAgent`.\n",
    "- AgentChat takes care of sending messages and keeping track of the conversation.\n",
    "- Learn more: [AgentChat Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/introduction.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Extensions\n",
    "- You can add new features to your agents by plugging in extensions.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Connect to OpenAI or Azure\n",
    "  - Add math tools\n",
    "  - Link to weather data or databases\n",
    "- You can use official extensions or make your own.\n",

    "\n",
    "### a. Bench\n",
    "- Lets you test how well your agents perform, especially when there are lots of tasks.\n",
