To start the Google Maps MCP server using the configuration in mcp.json, you need to run the following command in your terminal, providing your Google Maps API key when prompted:

ANSWER:
The error indicates that npx is not installed or not available in your system PATH. npx comes with Node.js, so you need to install Node.js to use this command.

Would you like me to guide you through installing Node.js, or do you already have it installed elsewhere? Once Node.js is installed, you can rerun the command to start the Google Maps MCP server.

ANSWER:

You can install Node.js manually by downloading the installer from the official website:  https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After installation, restart your terminal and try running the npx command again. Let me know once Node.js is installed, or if you need step-by-step instructions for the manual installation.
