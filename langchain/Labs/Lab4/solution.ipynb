    "In this lab, you'll harness the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and combine it with your custom Google_map tool from Lab2. Your challenge is to integrate these two components: use the Google_map tool to answer location-based queries, and leverage RAG (from Lab3) to provide context-rich answers from your company policy document. By merging tool use and RAG, you'll build an advanced agent capable of both retrieving document knowledge and interacting with external tools for dynamic, real-world tasks."
