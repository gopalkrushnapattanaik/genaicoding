    "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines the power of language models with external knowledge sources. RAGs retrieve relevant information from documents or databases and use it to generate more accurate and context-aware responses. This approach is widely used in modern AI applications to improve the quality and reliability of generated answers."
