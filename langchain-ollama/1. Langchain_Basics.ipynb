    "Welcome to the LangChain + Ollama lab! In this hands-on notebook, you'll learn how to use LangChain to interact with locally running Ollama models. We'll cover everything from installing dependencies to sending your first prompt and interpreting the model's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain makes it easy to build advanced AI applications, and Ollama's models can answer questions, generate text, and much more. By the end of this lab, you'll have a working demo and a foundation for your own AI projects.\n",
